Devantech SRF08 Ultrasonic Ranger Module

This directory contains a complete test program using the Devantech
SRF08 with the BDMICRO MAVRIC and MAVRIC-II microcontroller boards.
This program is intended to demonstrate how to use the BDMICRO MAVRIC
or MAVRIC-II microcontroller boards in conjunction with SRF08
Ultrasonic Ranger Module.  Feel free to copy the relevent function
definitions into your own applications and to customize them for your
needs.

The code is written in C using the GNU GCC C Compiler.  A Makefile is
provided which is known to work correctly on the FreeBSD Unix
operating system.

Configuration:
 
  Simply attach your SRF08 Ultrasonic Ranger Module to your board's
  I2C bus, power, and ground.  It's OK to use one of the supplied VCC
  pins on your microcontroller board to supply power to the SRF08.
 
  If desired, attach a terminal to UART0 for 9600, 8N1; the SRF08 will
  be read once per second and the result in inches printed to UART0.
